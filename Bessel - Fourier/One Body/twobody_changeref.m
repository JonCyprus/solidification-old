function [twobodypref] = twobody_changeref(r,p, two_body)
% This function is designed to adjust the vector p for use in the
% onebodydistribution code. The p is changed from a value of ~0 to the
% far field p value of 1. It is designed such that there is a smooth transition from r1 to r2.
% This code is intended to be used with interp_data to interpolate a 2-D grid for the onebodydistribution code.
% It is not directly called here since matlab does not allow for such
% functionality.

% Bound Parameters
r1 = 15;
r2 = 16;

% Calculating factor to smoothly decrease
damping_factor = zeros(size(r));
